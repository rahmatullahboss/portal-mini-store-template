- **Tablet**: 768px-1199px (adapted grid, stacked layouts)
- **Mobile**: <768px (single column, touch-friendly buttons)

## Streaming & Loading States

- Homepage data fetching for authentication and the product catalog now starts in parallel before any UI rendering.
- The hero section streams right away, and the product grid resolves inside a `Suspense` boundary with a skeleton layout that prevents layout shift.
- A matching header skeleton keeps navigation placement stable while user session data resolves.

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Proper separation of user and admin permissions
- **Authentication Required**: Protected routes for ordering and admin functions
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all order data
- **Price Verification**: Server validates prices to prevent manipulation
