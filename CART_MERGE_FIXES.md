# Cart Merge and Quantity Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Existing Items Creating New Entries Instead of Increasing Quantity
**Problem**: When adding an existing item to the cart, instead of increasing the quantity, it was creating a new item entry.

**Root Cause**: Complex merging logic in the `syncCartFromServer` function was causing conflicts between local and server items.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified the merging logic to properly combine quantities of existing items
- Created a straightforward approach that preserves local items and merges server items

### 2. Automatic Items Being Deleted
**Problem**: Automatic items (items added programmatically) were being deleted during cart synchronization.

**Root Cause**: The previous merging algorithm was overly complex and didn't properly handle all item types.

**Solution**:
- Implemented a cleaner merging approach that preserves all items
- Ensured both local and server items are properly combined

## Technical Changes

### Frontend (cart-context.tsx)

1. **Simplified Sync Logic** (`syncCartFromServer` function):
   - Replaced complex merging algorithm with a straightforward approach
   - Items that exist both locally and on server now have their quantities properly combined
   - Items that exist only locally are preserved
   - Items that exist only on server are added

2. **Improved Persistence Logic** (`persistCartToServer` function):
   - Fixed the way cart items are sent to the server
   - Now sending actual cart items instead of a snapshot
   - Simplified the comparison logic for determining when to persist

### Key Improvements

1. **Quantity Management**: 
   - Existing items now properly increase quantity when added again
   - No more duplicate entries for the same item

2. **Item Preservation**:
   - All items (manual and automatic) are preserved during synchronization
   - No more accidental deletion of items

3. **Simplified Logic**:
   - Removed complex merging algorithm that was causing issues
   - Implemented clear, understandable logic that's easier to maintain

## Testing the Fixes

1. Add an item to the cart
2. Add the same item again
3. Verify the quantity increases instead of creating a new entry
4. Add automatic items (programmatically)
5. Verify they're not deleted during synchronization
6. Test across different browsers/devices
7. Verify items are properly synchronized

## Benefits

1. **Correct Quantity Handling**: Items properly increase quantity when added multiple times
2. **Item Preservation**: No more accidental deletion of items
3. **Better User Experience**: More predictable cart behavior
4. **Simplified Code**: Easier to understand and maintain
5. **Cross-Device Consistency**: Items properly synchronize across devices
